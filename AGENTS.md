# AGENTS.md

OpenWork is an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork.

Read INFRASTRUCTURE.md

## Why OpenWork Exists

**Cowork is closed-source and locked to Claude Max.** We need an open alternative.
**Mobile-first matters.** People want to run tasks from their phones, including via messaging surfaces like WhatsApp and Telegram through owpenbot.
**Slick UI is non-negotiable.** The experience must feel premium, not utilitarian.

## Agent Guidelines for development

* **Purpose-first UI**: prioritize clarity, safety, and approachability for non-technical users.
* **Parity with OpenCode**: anything the UI can do must map cleanly to OpenCode tools.
* **Prefer OpenCode primitives**: represent concepts using OpenCode’s native surfaces first (folders/projects, `.opencode`, `opencode.json`, skills, plugins) before introducing new abstractions.
* **Self-referential**: maintain a gitignored mirror of OpenCode at `vendor/opencode` for inspection.
* **Self-building**: prefer prompts, skills, and composable primitives over bespoke logic.
* **Open source**: keep the repo portable; no secrets committed.
* **Slick and fluid**: 60fps animations, micro-interactions, premium feel.
* **Mobile-native**: touch targets, gestures, and layouts optimized for small screens.

## Technology Stack

| Layer                | Technology                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Desktop/Mobile shell | Tauri 2.x                 |
| Frontend             | SolidJS + TailwindCSS     |
| State                | Solid stores + IndexedDB  |
| IPC                  | Tauri commands + events   |
| OpenCode integration | Spawn CLI or embed binary |

## Repository Guidance

* Use `VISION.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` to understand the "why" and requirements so you can guide your decisions.

## OpenCode SDK Usage

OpenWork integrates with OpenCode via:

1.  **Non-interactive mode**: `opencode -p "prompt" -f json -q`
2.  **Database access**: Read `.opencode/opencode.db` for sessions and messages.

Key primitives to expose:

* `session.Service` — Task runs, history
* `message.Service` — Chat bubbles, tool calls
* `agent.Service` — Task execution, progress
* `permission.Service` — Permission prompts
* `tools.BaseTool` — Step-level actions

## Safety + Accessibility

* Default to least-privilege permissions and explicit user approvals.
* Provide transparent status, progress, and reasoning at every step.
* WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
* Screen reader labels for all interactive elements.

## Performance Targets

| Metric                 | Target         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| First contentful paint | <500ms         |
| Time to interactive    | <1s            |
| Animation frame rate   | 60fps          |
| Interaction latency    | <100ms         |
| Bundle size (JS)       | <200KB gzipped |

## Skill: SolidJS Patterns

When editing SolidJS UI (`packages/app/src/**/*.tsx`), consult:

* `.opencode/skills/solidjs-patterns/SKILL.md`

This captures OpenWork’s preferred reactivity + UI state patterns (avoid global `busy()` deadlocks; use scoped async state).

## Skill: Trigger a Release

OpenWork releases are built by GitHub Actions (`Release App`). A release is triggered by pushing a `v*` tag (e.g. `v0.1.6`).

### Standard release (recommended)

1.  Ensure `main` is green and up to date.
2.  Bump versions (keep these in sync):

* `packages/app/package.json` (`version`)
* `packages/desktop/package.json` (`version`)
* `packages/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`version`)
* `packages/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (`version`)

You can bump all three non-interactively with:

* `pnpm bump:patch`
* `pnpm bump:minor`
* `pnpm bump:major`
* `pnpm bump:set -- 0.1.21`

3.  Merge the version bump to `main`.
4.  Create and push a tag:
    * `git tag vX.Y.Z`
    * `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

This triggers the workflow automatically (`on: push.tags: v*`).

### Re-run / repair an existing release

If the workflow needs to be re-run for an existing tag (e.g. notarization retry), use workflow dispatch:

* `gh workflow run "Release App" --repo different-ai/openwork -f tag=vX.Y.Z`

### Verify

* Runs: `gh run list --repo different-ai/openwork --workflow "Release App" --limit 5`
* Release: `gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo different-ai/openwork`

Confirm the DMG assets are attached and versioned correctly.

## Skill: Publish openwrk (npm)

This is separate from app release tags. Use `.opencode/skills/openwrk-npm-publish/SKILL.md`.

1.  Ensure the default branch is up to date and clean.
2.  Bump `packages/headless/package.json` (`version`).
3.  Commit the bump.
4.  Build and upload sidecar assets for the same version tag:
    * `pnpm --filter openwrk build:sidecars`
    * `gh release create openwrk-vX.Y.Z packages/headless/dist/sidecars/* --repo different-ai/openwork`
5.  Publish:
    * `pnpm --filter openwrk publish --access public`
6.  Verify:
    * `npm view openwrk version`
