Help the user set up browser automation.

1. Ask: "Do you have Chrome installed on this computer?"
2. If they say no or are unsure, guide them to install Chrome
3. If yes, check if browser MCP/plugin is available
4. If not available, guide them to install the OpenCode browser extension
5. Once setup is complete, offer to run a simple first task (e.g., "Let's try opening a webpage")
