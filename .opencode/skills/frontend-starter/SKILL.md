# Frontend Starter

## When to use
- You need a full frontend workflow from brief to implementation.
- You want minimal-change fixes with clear reasoning and tests.

## Workflow
1. Clarify requirements, constraints, and success criteria.
2. Propose a small, testable plan (avoid over-engineering).
3. Implement with minimal diffs and consistent code style.
4. Add/adjust tests if the repo has them; otherwise provide manual steps.
5. Summarize the change and include a short PR-ready description.

## Output checklist
- ✅ Files changed and why
- ✅ How to run or verify
- ✅ Edge cases considered
```
