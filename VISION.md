# OpenWork Vision

OpenWork helps users ship agentic workflows to their team. Today it makes it easy for teams to re-use their existing opencode workflows and share it with their team.

It works on top of opencode (opencode.ai) an agentic coding platform that exposes apis and sdks. We care about maximally using the opencode primitives. And build the thinest possible layer - always favoring opencode apis over custom built ones.

In other words:
- OpenCode is the **engine**.
- OpenWork is the **experience** : onboarding, safety, permissions, progress, artifacts, and a premium-feeling UI.

OpenWork competes directly with Anthropic's Cowork conceptually, but stays open, local-first, and standards-based.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing OpenCode's CLI/TUI.
- Creating bespoke "magic" capabilities that don't map to OpenCode APIs.
